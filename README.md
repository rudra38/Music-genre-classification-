# Course Project CS F320 Foundations of Data Science BITS Pilani
A Machine Learning approach to music genre classification (collection of models)

# Music Genre Classification Project

## Overview
This project leverages KNN , Random Forest ,SVM and CNN models to classify music genres, utilizing the GTZAN dataset. The implementation of LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations) provides explanations for model predictions, helping users understand why a specific genre is suggested for a track. 

The supported genres include:
- Rock
- Pop
- Jazz
- Hip-hop
- Classical
- Blues
- Country
- Disco
- Metal
- Reggae

## Key Features

**Genre Classification Models:**  
The project employs KNN , Random Forest , SVM and CNN models to classify music genres based on audio features.

## Steps to run the code :
1) Download the GTZAN dataset from Kaggle from the link below (and un-ZIP the folder)
2) Load the dataset (entirely) on google drive (this may take some time)
3) Open google colab or any other environment and run the python notebooks

## To Clone
```bash
git clone https://github.com/GeneralIroh04/Course-Project-CS-F320-Foundations-of-Data-Science-BITS-Pilani-.git
```
